# Algorithm Challenge #24 – Uppercase First Letter of Each Word (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a line of text and converts the first letter
of each word to uppercase.

The solution performs the transformation directly on the string
without creating additional data structures.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Detecting word boundaries in strings
- Performing in-place string transformations
- Using character utilities like `toupper`
- Writing efficient text-processing algorithms
- Applying clean and maintainable logic

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**

enter your text:

hello world from c++

**Output:**

Hello World From C++

---

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** uppercase_first_letter_each_word.cpp
- **Challenge Number:** #24
- **Level:** 3

---

💬 Notes
-
This challenge builds directly on the previous string parsing problem
by extending it from detection to transformation.

It demonstrates how small logical changes can significantly increase
the usefulness of an algorithm.
